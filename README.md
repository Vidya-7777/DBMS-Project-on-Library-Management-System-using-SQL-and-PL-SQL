# Library Management System — DBMS Project

## Overview
This project implements a Library Management System using **SQL** and **PL/SQL**, designed as part of the DBMS course.  
It simulates a real-world academic library environment where books, students, and staff interact through borrowing, returning, and fine payment mechanisms.

---

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to design and manage a relational database for a library using **structured queries** and **procedural logic**. 
The system handles book lending, return due dates, fines, and provides meaningful insights through advanced SQL queries.

From creating normalized tables with primary and foreign keys to writing advanced queries and using PL/SQL constructs like **cursors** and **user input prompts**, 
this project brings together both the theoretical and practical aspects of database management.

## Project Structure

The project includes:

- Table creation scripts with primary and foreign keys
- Data insertion queries
- Update queries for calculating due dates
- PL/SQL procedures and cursors
- Advanced SQL queries to extract insights

---

## Key Features & Queries
- List students who borrowed books after a specific date
- Find students who haven’t borrowed any books
- Identify staff with no fines
- Compare fines with average paid fines
- Use of user prompts to fetch book details
- Use of cursors to list female students
- Locate books by floor and track returns
- Find books borrowed by a specific student
- Calculate maximum books borrowed by a student
- Compute total fine paid per student

## Conclusion

This Library Management System project demonstrates how SQL and PL/SQL can be effectively used to manage and interact with a relational database. It covers essential DBMS concepts like table creation, relational integrity, data manipulation, and procedural extensions, providing a solid foundation for larger database-driven applications.
